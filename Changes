# Changes for IRC::Server::Tree

* 0.05 (06 Sep 2012)

  Tree;
    Drop bless() when adding an existing IRC::Server::Tree to a node.

  Tree::Network;
    Add split_peer_nodes() to simplify moving nodes.
    
* 0.04 (04 Sep 2012)

  Tree;
    Fix path_by_indexes to not screw with the arrayref originally
    passed in; this was breaking Network if memoize => 1

  Tree::Network;
    Fix memoize/route preservation.

* 0.03 (03 Sep 2012)

  Tree; 
    Add method path_by_indexes() for resolving names given a 
    trace_indexes hop route.

  Tree::Network;
    Trade back some memory for some CPU time in preserving routes;
    cache only their index-based route rather than hop names, walk 
    the route to fetch names via Tree->path_by_indexes()

    'memoize => 0' in constructor will turn off route preservation.

    Fix slightly malfunctioning constructor.

* 0.02 (02 Sep 2012)

  Fix a syntax error in bin/irc-tree-repl

* 0.01 (02 Sep 2012)

  Initial release
